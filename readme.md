# Tire Volume Calculator

A simple Python script to calculate the approximate air volume of a tire based on ETRTO (European Tyre and Rim Technical Organization) measurements, such as `622x45`.

## Features
- Takes tire dimensions in ETRTO format as input (e.g., `622x45`).
- Calculates the approximate air volume of the tire in liters.
- Outputs results via the command line.

## Installation

1. Ensure you have Python 3.6 or newer installed on your system.
2. Clone this repository or download the script:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/tire-volume-calculator.git
   cd tire-volume-calculator

Usage
	1.	Run the script from the command line:

python tire_volume.py 622x45


	2.	Replace 622x45 with your desired tire size in ETRTO format.

Example

python tire_volume.py 622x45

Output:

Approximate air volume for tire 622x45: 3.48 liters

How It Works

The script uses the dimensions provided to calculate the air volume assuming the tire is a torus (a donut-like shape). It employs the following formula for the volume of a torus:

[ V = 2 \cdot \pi^2 \cdot R \cdot r^2 ]

Where:
	•	( R ) is the major radius (distance from the center of the torus to the center of the tube), calculated as half the inner diameter.
	•	( r ) is the minor radius (radius of the tire cross-section), calculated as half the tire width.

The result is converted from cubic meters to liters for easier interpretation.

Limitations
	•	This calculation assumes a perfect torus shape, which is a simplified approximation.
	•	Input must follow the ETRTO format (e.g., 622x45). Other formats will not be recognized.
